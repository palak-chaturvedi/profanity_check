# profanity_check
This checks the degree of profanity of racial slurs in twitter comments.


I have used web scraping to download all the ethinic and racial slurs from wikipedia table of "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs" in a text file named "data.txt".
Then using tokenizer and found the degree of profanity by the number of slurs in the sentence.
The twitter comments are stored in "twitter_comments.txt"
